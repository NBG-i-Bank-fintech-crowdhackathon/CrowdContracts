# Loyalty_Points

This code consists of 2 files, contract.sol and index.html.
These have to be imported in Ethereum's Mix IDE (v.1.0.3)
After creating a new project and importing the 2 files, you have to execute this command in JS console
web3.eth.defaultAccount = web3.eth.accounts[0] 	
(see also https://forum.ethereum.org/discussion/3530/web3-js-line-3748-uncaught-invalid-address )
Then click on "add transaction" and "create contract".
